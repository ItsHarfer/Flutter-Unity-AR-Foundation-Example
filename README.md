# Unity-Flutter-AR-Foundation-example
This project aims to enable users to have AR experiences for iOS and for Android. This is made possible by the game engine Unity and its package: AR Foundation. 
To bring the AR experience from Unity to Flutter, the plugin "flutter_unity" from [cookiejarlid](https://github.com/Glartek/flutter-unity/commits?author=cookiejarlid) is used. 
In the example scene, the user can test an AR scene with the printed image (images/rocky.jpg), which is an example of image tracking. Have fun

## Flutter configuration
* Import the project dependecies by running `flutter pub get` from your terminal

## Unity project build settings
* Connect android or ios device and try `flutter run` (device only, no simulator support)
* If necessary, follow the instructions for the plugin [cookiejarlid](https://github.com/Glartek/flutter-unity/)
